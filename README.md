#Jason's Mac Setup Script

I don't expect anyone besides myself to use this. But if you find it helpful, then that's fantastic... though it's probably only useful as insight into the software I run.

## Philosophy

Generally I don't keep full system backups of my personal or work computers. Systems aren't important. Data files are.

Think of it like "immutable infrastructure" for laptops.

A vast majority of my data files are code and so they're regularly synced and backed up to various git repositories. The other files are typically content pieces that I write in Google Docs or presentation files that I store in a synced Google Drive. This means I have very little data that needs real backing up. For those files, I use Apple's Time Machine and an external USB3 RAID1 drive.

So my goal isn't about restoring to a specific point in time for a system, but rather quickly rebuilding the system and reconnecting persistant data stores.

To that end, this script is largely just a manifest of software with automation to reinstall it.

## Tip 'o the hat

Huge thanks to the folks who write homebrew, mas, cask and all the people who provide recipes for them.
